Dive into Machine Learning 

Tools you'll need
Python. Python 3 is the best option.
IPython and the Jupyter Notebook. (FKA IPython and IPython Notebook.)
Some scientific computing packages:
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
You can install Python 3 and all of these packages in a few clicks with the Anaconda Python distribution. Anaconda is popular in Data Science and Machine Learning communities.

Learn how to use IPython Notebook (5-10 minutes). 

scikit-learn is the go-to library for machine learning in Python. It's used widely. 

I encourage you to look at the scikit-learn homepage and spend about 5 minutes looking over the names of the strategies (Classification, Regression, etc.), and their applications. Don't click through yet! Just get a glimpse of the vocabulary.

Dive in
A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning
Let's learn a bit more about Machine Learning, and a couple of common ideas and concerns. Read "A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning, Part 1" by Stephanie Yee and Tony Chu.

A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning, Part 1

A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning

What has the most impact in Machine Learning

(Chart inspired by a slide from Alex Pinto's talk, "Secure Because Math: A Deep-Dive on ML-Based Monitoring".)

Jargon note
What is the difference between Data Analytics, Data Analysis, Data Mining, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Big Data?
Another handy term: Data Engineering, which may involve or support Machine Learning, but is not limited to Machine Learning.
Just about time for a break...
Before you take a break, grab some podcasts.

First, download an interview with Prof. Domingos on the Data Skeptic podcast (2018). Prof. Domingos wrote the paper we read earlier. You might also start reading his book, The Master Algorithm by Prof. Pedro Domingos, a clear and accessible overview of machine learning.

Next, subscribe to more machine learning and data science podcasts! These are great, low-effort resources that you can casually learn more from. To learn effectively, listen over time, with plenty of headspace. Do not speed up your podcasts!

Subscribe to Talking Machines.

I suggest this listening order:

Download the "Starting Simple" episode, and listen to that soon. It supports what we read from Domingos. Ryan Adams talks about starting simple, as we discussed above. Adams also stresses the importance of feature engineering. Feature engineering is an exercise of the "knowledge" Domingos writes about. In a later episode, they share many concrete tips for feature engineering.
Then, over time, you can listen to the entire podcast series (start from the beginning).
Want to subscribe to more podcasts? Here's a good listicle of suggestions, and another.

Face Recognition on a subset of the Labeled Faces in the WildMachine Learning from Disaster: Using Titanic data, "Demonstrates basic data munging, analysis, and visualization techniques. Shows examples of supervised machine learning techniques."
Election Forecasting: A replication of the model Nate Silver used to make predictions about the 2012 US Presidential Election for the New York Times.
An example Machine Learning notebook: "let's pretend we're working for a startup that just got funded to create a smartphone app that automatically identifies species of flowers from pictures taken on the smartphone. We've been tasked by our head of data science to create a demo machine learning model that takes four measurements from the flowers (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and identifies the species based on those measurements alone."

 Pick one of the courses below and start on your way.

Recommended course: Prof. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning on Coursera
Prof. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning is a popular and esteemed free online course. I've seen it recommended often. And emphatically.

It's helpful if you decide on a pet project to play around with, as you go, so you have a way to apply your knowledge. You could use one of these Awesome Public Datasets. And remember, IPython Notebook is your friend.

Also, you should grab an in-depth textbook to use as a reference. The two best options are Understanding Machine Learning and Elements of Statistical Learning. You'll see these recommended as reference textbooks. You only need to use one of the two options as your main reference; here's some context/comparison to help you pick which one is right for you. You can download each book free as PDFs at those links - so grab them!

Tips for studying
Busy schedule? Read Ray Li's review of Prof. Andrew Ng's course for some helpful tips.
Review some of the "Learning How to Learn" videos. This is just about how to study in general. In the course, they advocate the learn-by-doing approach, as we're doing here. You'll get various other tips that are easy to apply, but go a long way to make your time investment more effective.
Other courses
Here are some other free online courses I've seen recommended. (Machine Learning, Data Science, and related topics.)

Prof. Pedro Domingos's introductory video series. Domingos wrote the paper "A Few Useful Things to Know About Machine Learning", recommended earlier in this guide.
Kevin Markham's video series, Intro to Machine Learning with scikit-learn, starts with what we've already covered, then continues on at a comfortable place. After the videos you could do Markham's General Assembly's Data Science course. Interactive. Markham's course is also offered in-person in Washington, DC.
UC Berkeley's Data 8: The Foundations of Data Science course and the textbook Computational and Inferential Thinking teaches critical concepts in Data Science.
The textbook also provides an academic definition of Data Science: "Data Science is about drawing useful conclusions from large and diverse data sets through exploration, prediction, and inference".
Foundations of Data Science online course based on Data 8 is now offered via edX too.
Data science courses as IPython Notebooks:
Practical Data Science
Learn Data Science (an entire self-directed course!)

Assorted Opinions and Other Resources
More Data Science materials
I'm not repeating the materials mentioned above, but here are some other Data Science resources:

Extremely accessible data science book: Data Smart by John Foreman
An entire self-directed course in Data Science, as a IPython Notebook
Data Science Workflow: Overview and Challenges (read the article and also the comment by Joseph McCarthy)
Fun little IPython Notebook: Web Scraping Indeed.com for Key Data Science Job Skills
Swami Chandrasekaran's "Becoming a Data Scientist" is a concise, printable picture of a data science curriculum
Python Data Science Handbook is one of the best entry level book that you can find on Internet.
Bayesian Statistics and Machine Learning
From the "Bayesian Machine Learning" overview on Metacademy:

... Bayesian ideas have had a big impact in machine learning in the past 20 years or so because of the flexibility they provide in building structured models of real world phenomena. Algorithmic advances and increasing computational resources have made it possible to fit rich, highly structured models which were previously considered intractable.

You can learn more by studying one of the following resources. Both resources use Python, PyMC, and Jupyter Notebooks.

The free book, Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers. Made with a "computation/understanding-first, mathematics-second point of view." It's available in print too!
Bayesian Modelling in Python
Like learning by playing? Me too. Try 19 Questions, "a machine learning game which asks you questions and guesses an object you are thinking about," and explains which Bayesian statistics techniques are being used.
Risks
"Machine learning systems automatically learn programs from data." Pedro Domingos, in "A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning." The programs you generate will require maintenance. Like any way of creating programs faster, you can rack up technical debt.

Here is the abstract of Machine Learning: The High-Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt:

Machine learning offers a fantastically powerful toolkit for building complex systems quickly. This paper argues that it is dangerous to think of these quick wins as coming for free. Using the framework of technical debt, we note that it is remarkably easy to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs at the system level when applying machine learning. The goal of this paper is highlight several machine learning specific risk factors and design patterns to be avoided or refactored where possible. These include boundary erosion, entanglement, hidden feedback loops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, changes in the external world, and a variety of system-level anti-patterns.

If you're following this guide, you should read that paper. You can also listen to a podcast episode interviewing one of the authors of this paper.

Welcome to the Danger Zone
So you are dabbling with Machine Learning. You've got Hacking Skills. Maybe you've got some "knowledge" in Domingos' sense (some "Substantive Expertise" or "Domain Knowledge"). This diagram is modified slightly from Drew Conway's "Data Science Venn Diagram." It isn't a perfect fit for us, but it may get the point across:

Drew Conway's Data Science Venn Diagram, modified slightly

Please don't sell yourself as a Machine Learning expert while you're still in the Danger Zone. Don't build bad products or publish junk science. (Also please don't be evil.) This guide can't tell you how you'll know you've "made it" into Machine Learning competence ... let alone expertise. It's hard to evaluate proficiency without schools or other institutions. This is a common problem for self-taught people.

Towards Expertise
You need practice. On Hacker News, user olympus commented to say you could use competitions to practice and evaluate yourself. Kaggle and ChaLearn are hubs for Machine Learning competitions. You can find some examples of code for popular Kaggle competitions here. For smaller exercises, try HackerRank.

You also need understanding. You should review what Kaggle competition winners say about their solutions, for example, the "No Free Hunch" blog. These might be over your head at first but once you're starting to understand and appreciate these, you know you're getting somewhere.

Competitions and challenges are just one way to practice. You shouldn't limit yourself, though - and you should also understand that Machine Learning isn't all about Kaggle competitions.

Here's a complementary way to practice: do practice studies.

I think the best advice is to tell people to always present their methods clearly and to avoid over-interpreting their results. Part of being an expert is knowing that there's rarely a clear answer, especially when you're working with real data.

As you repeat this process, your practice studies will become more scientific, interesting, and focused. The most important part of this process is peer review.

Ask for Peer Review
Here are some communities where you can reach out for peer review:

Cross-Validated: stats.stackexchange.com
/r/DataIsBeautiful
/r/DataScience
/r/MachineLearning
Hacker News: news.ycombinator.com. You'll probably want to submit as "Show HN"
Post to any of those, and ask for feedback. You'll get feedback. You'll learn a ton. As experts review your work you will learn a lot about the field. You'll also be practicing a crucial skill: accepting critical feedback.

When I read the feedback on my Pull Requests, first I repeat to myself, "I will not get defensive, I will not get defensive, I will not get defensive." You may want to do that before you read reviews of your Machine Learning work too.

Collaborate with Domain Experts!
Machine Learning can be powerful, but it is not magic.

Whenever you apply Machine Learning to solve a problem, you are going to be working in some specific problem domain. To get good results, you or your team will need "substantive expertise" AKA "domain knowledge." Learn what you can, for yourself... But you should also collaborate. You'll have better results if you collaborate with domain experts. (What's a domain expert? See the Wikipedia entry, or c2 wiki's rather subjective but useful blurb.)

ðŸ™‡ A note about Machine Learning and User Experience (UX)

Machine learning wonâ€™t figure out what problems to solve. If you arenâ€™t aligned with a human need, youâ€™re just going to build a very powerful system to address a very smallâ€”or perhaps nonexistentâ€”problem.

Quote is from "The UX of AI" by Josh Lovejoy, whole article is a great read!

In other words, You Are Not The User.

Today we are surrounded by software that utilizes Machine Learning. Often, the results are directly user-facing, and intended to enhance UX.

Before you start working ML into your software, you should get a better understanding of UX, as well as how ML and UX can relate. As an informal way to get into this subject, start with this:

Rule #23 of Martin Zinkevich's Rules of ML Engineering: "You are not a typical end user."
There are some great thoughtful discussions of this on Quora
Then, if you you know a coworker or friend who works in UX, take them out for coffee or lunch and pick their brain. I think they'll have words of encouragement as well as caution. You won't be an expert by any means, but maybe it'll help you konw if/when to reach out for help, review, or guidance.

Spoiler: you should work with UX specialists whenever you can!

ðŸ™‡ A note about Machine Learning and Security (InfoSec, AppSec)
There was a great BlackHat webcast on this topic, Secure Because Math: Understanding Machine Learning-Based Security Products. Slides are here, video recording is here. If you're using ML to recommend some media, overfitting could be harmless. If you're relying on ML to protect from threats, overfitting could be downright dangerous. Check the full presentation if you are interested in this space.

If you want to explore this space more deeply, there is a lot of reading material in the below links:

Deep Learning
In early editions of this guide, there was no specific "Deep Learning" section. I omitted it intentionally. I think it is not effective for us to jump too far ahead. I also know that if you become an expert in traditional Machine Learning, you'll be capable of moving onto advanced subjects like Deep Learning, whether or not I've put that in this guide. We're just trying to get you started here!

Maybe this is a way to check your progress: ask yourself, does Deep Learning seem like magic? If so, take that as a sign that you aren't ready to work with it professionally. Let the fascination motivate you to learn more. I have read some argue you can learn Deep Learning in isolation; I have read others recommend it's best to master traditional Machine Learning first. Why not start with traditional Machine Learning, and develop your reasoning and intuition there? You'll only have an easier time learning Deep Learning after that. After all of it, you'll able to tackle all sorts of interesting problems.

In any case, when you decide you're ready to dive into Deep Learning, here are some helpful resources.
